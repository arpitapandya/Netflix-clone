# Netflix Clone

## Demo

[Live Site](https://netflix-3b27e.web.app/)

### Technologies used

Languages/Libraries: JavaScript, React, React Hooks, React Testing Library, Styled Components and lastly the design pattern of Compound Components.

### Approach

This application is built using React, Firebase & Styled Components. In React i have used Custom Hooks & Context. I have built different pages within this application such as: Sign In, Sign Up, Browse page & Homepage.

There are four different pages, some using protected routes with auth listeners. Firebase firestore handles all the data and that data is retrieved using a custom hook, authentication is used on all pages, which is handled by Firebase as well.

Compound components used for design pattern to build the components. The styling is fully handled via styled components.

### More of what I learned

- React useEffect, useState, useContext
- JavaScript using higher order functions such as map, filter, reduce, and find.
- Fuse.js for live search,
- Tested all the components using React Testing Library.
- React router for navigation.
